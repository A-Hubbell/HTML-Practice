            This webpage is being used for practing HTML. As more features are learned, it will be updated further. The image of the code snippet is currently not horizontally-centered. I haven't been able to find a good way to do it in HTML, so it will be updated when I learn CSS. Below is a list of what functionality is currently being used on this page.

        <p>With no previous HTML experience whatsoever I started the HTML/CSS course on codecademy (check it out <a href="http://codecademy.com/learn/">here</a>). After only a few hours, I was able to create this webpage. Codecademy is awesome!

        <!-- Character Entities -->
        <hr>
        <h3>Useful Character Entities</h2>
        <p>There are a number of "reserved" characters in html such as &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and non-breaking white space. There is a special way to have these characters displayed in your text as opposed to be skipped over or considered as part of tags. HTML also supports some math symbols, greek letters and other "symbols", which are not considered as character entities. Here are a few examples of character entities:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Ampersand (&amp;): "&amp;amp;"</li>
            <li>Less than (&lt;): "&amp;lt;"</li>
            <li>Greater than (&gt;): "&amp;gt;"</li>
            <li>Copyright (&copy;): "&amp;copy;"</li>
            <li>Registered Trademark (&reg;): "&amp;reg;"</li>
        </ul>
